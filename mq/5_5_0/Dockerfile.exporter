# This Dockerfile shows how you can both build and run a container with 
# a specific exporter/collector program. It uses two stages, copying the relevant
# material from the build step into the runtime container.
#
# It can cope with both platforms where a Redistributable Client is available, and platforms
# where it is not - copy the .deb install images for such platforms into the MQDEB
# subdirectory of this repository first.

# Global ARG. To be used in all stages.
# Override with "--build-arg EXPORTER=mq_xxxxx" when building.

# Install MQ client and SDK
# For platforms with a Redistributable client, we can use curl to pull it in and unpack it.
# For other platforms, we assume that you have the deb files available under the current directory
# and we then copy them into the container image. Use dpkg to install from them; these have to be 
# done in the right order.
# 
# If additional Redistributable Client platforms appear, then this block can be altered, including the MQARCH setting.
# 
# The copy of the README is so that at least one file always gets copied, even if you don't have the deb files locally. 
# Using a wildcard in the directory name also helps to ensure that this part of the build should always succeed.
